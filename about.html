  <h1>THIS IS ME, Hello</h1>
  <h2>Hello! I’m Rosemary, a skilled designer/artworker and art editor with extensive experience in print and digital. </h2>
  <p>I cover the complete creative process, from understanding the brief and audience, conceptualising, testing and iterating designs to preparing print ready artwork and effective digital assets, delivered on time and in budget. I believe every
    stage is important and am just as happy artworking as generating ideas.

    Because I love what I do, I am always hard-working and enjoy a collaborative approach when working in a team. My work is stylish and functional with meticulous attention to detail and branding styles.

    I bring creativity and enthusiasm to every project and always remain adaptable and ego-free, putting the needs of the client and audience first.

    For more details, download my CV or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosemary-smith-design/">Linkedin</a>.

    To discuss a project or how I can help you, please email: rosemarysmithdesign@gmail.com or call: 07951 146 470</p>
